This is a prototype of a GAOL schedule generator in Python.
At present this is not intended as a replacement for Schedgen. APIs might change drastically.
The GOAL :) of this version is to make it easy to compose GOAL schedules, by keeping everything in memory.
Schedgen on the other hand is optimized to minimize memory footprint and does not easily allow composability, i.e., supporting communicators.
